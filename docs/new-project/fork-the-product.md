# Fork the Product 

The first step to start a new client project is to create a fork from the products repos which are the following:

- ***[PPlus](https://bitbucket.org/mwfrontend/pplus/src/master/)***
- ***[SPlus](https://bitbucket.org/mwfrontend/splus/src/master/)***

## How to fork

You can fork a repo on bitbucket by using the ***create (+) button*** found in the sidebar.

Then you should select the ***fork this repository*** option which will take you to the fork repository page.

In the fork page make sure to have the configuration as follows:

### Workspace

This should always be set to `mw-front-end`.

### Project

For PPlus it should be set to `pplus-frontend` and for SPlus it should be set to `splus-frontend`

### Project

For PPlus it should be set to `pplus-{{client-name}}` and for SPlus it should be set to `splus-{{client-name}}`

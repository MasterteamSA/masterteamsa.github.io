# Build your project

Build your site **for production**:

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files are generated in the `build` folder.

## To test your build

Test your production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

The `build` folder is now served at `http://localhost:3000/`.

:::info
If you don't have `serve` installed you can install it using
```
npm install -g serve
```
